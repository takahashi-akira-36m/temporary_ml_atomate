ML-atomate
====

Machine-learning-assisted atomate code for autonomous computational materials screening.
(This is for the review and only README, examples scripts, empty codes and help of priority_setter.py are updated.)


## Installation
Download or clone the github repository, e.g., git clone https://github.com/takahashi-akira-36m/ml_atomate


## Example
ml_atomate_path=(path to ml_atomate) 


<span style="color: darkorange; ">\# make directory and output POSCARs from Materials Project </span>  
python ${ml_atomate_path}/ml_atomate/example/a_generate_poscars.py POSCARs  
 <span style="color: darkorange; ">\# dump descriptor.csv </span>  
python ${ml_atomate_path}/ml_atomate/example/b_calc_descriptors.py POSCARs  
<span style="color: darkorange; ">\# initialize mongodb for fireworks, if necessary </span>  
lpad reset  
zsh ${ml_atomate_path}/example/c_atomate_wf.zsh # Make workflows from POSCARs/POSCAR*  
qsub d${ml_atomate_path}/example/d1_priority_setter_blox.sh # If you do not use grid engine, please use submit command instead of qsub  
<span style="color: darkorange; "> \# Wait a while (Until priority_{date}.log outputs "Waiting new acquired properties, sleeping XX sec...") </span>  
qlaunch -r rapidfire   


Customizing scripts in ml_atomate, you can set candidate substances, first-principles calculation workflows, descriptor and machine-learning methods.
